* [DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/other-scripts/DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua)
  > This script generates random Discord invites including a real invite which is editable in the variable "DiscordInviteCode", the real invite code will randonly pick a fake invite to replace with the real invite code. The rest of the message will be placed with random symbols as a distraction. **Perferably, you would use this in raiding discord servers or be annoying to people who want your discord invite code.**
  
  > Example
  ```lua
  local Token = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/master/other-scripts/DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua"))();
  print(Token("7EJ9MunQTt", 2000, math.random(1, 15)));
  ```
