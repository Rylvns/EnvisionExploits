### [Utility scripts](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/tree/master/utility-scripts)
* [ExpandTable.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/utility-scripts/ExpandTable.lua)
  > This script defines a function called ExpandTable that takes a table as input. It iterates over the table and converts its values into a formatted string representation, considering various data types. The resulting string includes nested tables and replicated values, providing a structured representation of the original table.

  > Example
  ```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/utility-scripts/ExpandTable.lua"))();
  print(ExpandTable({
    "1",
    [2] = 3,
    ["4"] = {
      [5] = workspace,
    };
    6,
    Instance.new("Part"),
    [workspace] = game,
  }));
  ```

### [Other scripts](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/tree/master/other-scripts)
* [DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/other-scripts/DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua)
  > This script generates random Discord invites including a real invite which is editable in the variable "DiscordInviteCode", the real invite code will randonly pick a fake invite to replace with the real invite code. The rest of the message will be placed with random symbols as a distraction. **Perferably, you would use this in raiding discord servers or be annoying to people who want your discord invite code.**
  
  > Example
  ```lua
  local Token = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/master/other-scripts/DiscordSymbolMessageGenerator.lua"))();
  print(Token("7EJ9MunQTt", 2000, math.random(1, 15)));
  ```
* [Timer+Pos-Save&Load.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/other-scripts/Timer%2BPos-Save%26Load/source.lua)
  > This script implements a timer functionality in your game, allowing the player to start and stop the timer by pressing the "Q" key. The timer will be displayed on the screen in the format "HH:MM:SS:MMM". This script can also save and load your humanoid root positions so you can playback where you went. **You would use this script in parkour maps.**
