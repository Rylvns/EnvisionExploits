# UTILITY SCRIPTS
* [ExpandTable.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/utility-scripts/ExpandTable.lua)
  > This script defines a function called ExpandTable that takes a table as input. It iterates over the table and converts its values into a formatted string representation, considering various data types. The resulting string includes nested tables and replicated values, providing a structured representation of the original table.

  > **Example**
  ```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/master/utility-scripts/ExpandTable.lua"))();
  print(ExpandTable{
      "1",
      [game.Players.LocalPlayer] = function()return"Cant be fetched."end,
      [os] = Vector3.new(1e0, 0.512e3, 5^25e2),
      [Vector2] = Vector3.new,
      ["4"] = {
          [5] = workspace,
      };
      [{1, 2, 3, 4, {{}, {}}}] = {{5, 6, RotationCurveKey}, Vector3.new, game:GetService("CoreGui")},
      [3] = Instance.new("Player"),
      [2] = Instance.new("Part", game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui),
      [workspace] = game,
  })
  ```
  > **Output**
  ```lua
  {
      [1] = "1",
      [2] = game.Players.Rylvns.PlayerGui.Part,
      [3] = Instance.new("Player"),
      [{
          [1] = 1,
          [2] = 2,
          [3] = 3,
          [4] = 4,
          [5] = {
              [1] = {},
              [2] = {},
          },
      }] = {
          [1] = {
              [1] = 5,
              [2] = 6,
              [3] = RotationCurveKey,
          },
          [2] = Vector3.new,
          [3] = game.CoreGui,
      },
      [game.Players.Rylvns] = function()end,

          ["clock"] = function()end,
          ["difftime"] = function()end,
          ["time"] = function()end,
          ["date"] = function()end,
      }] = Vector3.new(1, 512, inf),
      [game.Workspace] = game,
  };
  ```
* [CompressTable.lua](https://github.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/blob/master/utility-scripts/CompressTable.lua)
  > The code defines a function called CompressTable that takes a table as input and compresses it into a string representation. The function iterates over the table and converts the values into a compressed format based on their types, using a set of predefined conversions. The resulting compressed string is returned at the end.

  > **Example**

  ```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rylvns/EnvisionExploits/master/utility-scripts/CompressTable.lua"))();
  print(CompressTable{
    "1",
    [game.Players.LocalPlayer] = function()return"Cant be fetched."end,
    [os] = Vector3.new(1e0, 0.512e3, 5^25e2),
    [Vector2] = Vector3.new,
    ["4"] = {
        [5] = workspace,
    };
    [{1, 2, 3, 4, {{}, {}}}] = {{5, 6, RotationCurveKey}, Vector3.new, game:GetService("CoreGui")},
    [3] = Instance.new("Player"),
    [2] = Instance.new("Part", game.Players.LocalPlayer.PlayerGui),
    [workspace] = game,
  })
  ```

  > **Output**
  ```lua
  {[1] = "1", [2] = game.Players.Rylvns.PlayerGui.Part, [3] = Instance.new("Player"), [{[1] = 1, [2] = 2, [3] = 3, [4] = 4, [5] = {[1] = {}, [2] = {}}}] = {[1] = {[1] = 5, [2] = 6, [3] = RotationCurveKey}, [2] = Vector3.new, [3] = game.CoreGui}, [game.Players.Rylvns] = function()end, [Vector2] = Vector3.new, ["4"] = {[5] = game.Workspace}, [{["clock"] = function()end, ["difftime"] = function()end, ["time"] = function()end, ["date"] = function()end}] = Vector3.new(1, 512, inf), [game.Workspace] = game};
